# Text-to-Text Translation Deep Learning Project Roadmap

The goal of this project is to explore and implement various deep learning techniques for text-to-text translation. The focus will be on experimenting with different architectures and strategies to enhance translation accuracy and efficiency.

## Team Composition:
- BENGUEZZOU Idris
- KHALYFA Fatiha
- MEZIANE Ghilas

## Proposed Experimentation Steps:

### 1. Data exploration and Preprocessing:
- Explore the datasets and analyze the data distribution and characteristics.
- Perform necessary preprocessing steps such as tokenization, cleaning, and formatting.

### 2. Baseline Model Implementation:
- Implement a baseline model using traditional sequence-to-sequence models like LSTM or GRU.
- Evaluate the baseline model's performance on the chosen metrics.

### 3. Experimentation with Different Architectures:
- Explore and implement transformer-based architectures like the Transformer, BERT, GPT, or T5 for text translation.
- Experiment with varying model depths, attention mechanisms, and tokenization strategies to optimize translation performance.

### 4. Supervised Pre-training with Autoencoders:
- Investigate the use of autoencoders for pre-training the translation model.
- Evaluate the impact of pre-training on the model's translation capabilities.

### 5. Data Augmentation Techniques:
- Experiment with data augmentation methods such as back-translation, paraphrasing, or synthetic data generation to enhance training data diversity.

### 6. Loss Function and Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Fine-tune hyperparameters including learning rate, batch size, and regularization techniques.
- Explore different loss functions suitable for text-to-text translation tasks.

### 7. Evaluation Metrics:
- Define and justify chosen evaluation metrics such as BLEU score, ROUGE score, or other relevant metrics to assess model performance.
